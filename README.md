## 🚀 Why I Built This Project

This project was created as my final project for **Code in Place 2025**, a global initiative by Stanford University to make computer science education accessible to everyone. I wanted to build a console-based application that is both useful and practical.

I chose a **Mini Library System** because:
- It reinforces real-world programming logic (like record keeping)
- It’s useful for managing any small collection of books
- It includes all the core programming skills I learned

## 🏛️ What is Code in Place – Stanford CS106A?

[**Code in Place**](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) is a free, volunteer-led online course based on Stanford's CS106A curriculum. Thousands of students from around the world participate to learn the foundations of computer science using Python.

**CS106A (Programming Methodology)** is Stanford’s renowned introduction to computer science. It covers:
- Python fundamentals
- Control flow (loops, if/else)
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- File I/O
- Basic graphics and animation

## 🧠 What I Learned (April 2025 – June 2025)

Throughout Code in Place, I learned:
- Writing and organizing clean Python code
- Designing programs using control flow and logic
- Handling input/output from the console and files
- Creating interactive applications using functions and loops
- Debugging and thinking like a programmer
- Optional: Using basic graphics with the `graphics.py` module

This final project brought all these skills together into a complete, working program.

## 🔑 Features of This Project

- View all available books
- Add new books to the library
- Borrow and return books
- Track the status of each book (Available or Borrowed)
- Store book data in a local text file (`library_books.txt`) for persistence

## 💡 Importance of This Project

- 🧠 Reinforces logical thinking and condition-based programming  
- 🗂️ Demonstrates file handling in Python  
- 💬 Shows how to build real, interactive software using basic concepts  
- 🎓 Represents my growth from beginner to independent coder in 2 months!  

This project is a reflection of what consistent learning, mentorship, and practice can achieve—even in a short time.
